# Security Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the security practices and guidelines for the Tools project to ensure a secure, robust application.

## Backend Security (Rust/Axum)

### API Security

1. **Input Validation**
   - All user inputs must be validated on the server side
   - Use strong typing with Rust's type system
   - Reject invalid data with appropriate error messages
   - Sanitize file uploads and JSON data

2. **CORS Configuration**
   - CORS is currently set to `Any` for development
   - **PRODUCTION**: Restrict CORS to specific frontend domains
   - Update `backend/src/main.rs` CORS configuration before deployment

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement rate limiting for API endpoints to prevent abuse
   - Consider using middleware like `tower-governor`

4. **File Upload Security**
   - Validate file types and sizes for N26 analyzer
   - Scan uploaded files for malicious content
   - Never execute uploaded files
   - Store uploads temporarily and clean up after processing

5. **Error Handling**
   - Don't expose internal error details to clients
   - Log detailed errors server-side only
   - Return generic error messages to users

### Data Protection

1. **Sensitive Data**
   - N26 financial data should be processed in memory only
   - Never store uploaded financial data persistently without explicit user consent
   - Clear sensitive data from memory after processing

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Store secrets in environment variables
   - Never commit `.env` files to version control
   - Use different configurations for development/production

### Dependencies

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Regularly update dependencies: `cargo update`
   - Audit dependencies for vulnerabilities: `cargo audit`
   - Review new dependencies before adding them

2. **Minimal Dependencies**
   - Only include necessary crates
   - Prefer well-maintained, popular libraries

## Frontend Security (Next.js/React)

### Client-Side Security

1. **XSS Prevention**
   - React escapes output by default - don't use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
   - Validate and sanitize user inputs
   - Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

2. **Data Handling**
   - Process sensitive data (N26 JSON) client-side when possible
   - Don't log sensitive information to console in production
   - Clear sensitive data from state when component unmounts

3. **HTTPS Only**
   - Always use HTTPS in production
   - Set secure cookie flags
   - Implement HSTS headers

4. **Dependencies**
   - Run `npm audit` regularly
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Review security advisories

### API Communication

1. **API Calls**
   - Use environment variables for API endpoints
   - Validate API responses before using them
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add request timeouts

2. **Authentication** (Future)
   - When adding authentication, use secure token storage
   - Implement proper session management
   - Add CSRF protection

## Infrastructure Security

### Deployment

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Use separate environments (dev, staging, production)
   - Enable security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
   - Configure firewalls to restrict access

2. **Monitoring**
   - Implement logging for security events
   - Monitor for unusual activity
   - Set up alerts for security incidents

3. **Backups**
   - Regularly backup configuration
   - Test restore procedures
   - Encrypt backups

## Security Checklist for Production

- [ ] Update CORS configuration to restrict origins
- [ ] Enable HTTPS with valid certificates
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Review and update dependencies
- [ ] Run security audit tools
- [ ] Configure security headers
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Set up automated security scanning in CI/CD
- [ ] Document incident response procedures
- [ ] Conduct security testing

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please email the maintainer directly rather than opening a public issue. We take security seriously and will respond promptly.

## Security Tools

### Recommended Tools

**Rust Backend:**
- `cargo audit` - Security vulnerability scanner
- `cargo clippy` - Linting tool that catches security issues
- `cargo deny` - Check dependencies for security advisories

**Frontend:**
- `npm audit` - Security vulnerability scanner
- ESLint with security plugins
- Snyk - Automated security scanning

## Regular Security Tasks

1. **Weekly**
   - Review application logs
   - Check for new security advisories

2. **Monthly**
   - Update dependencies
   - Run security audits
   - Review access controls

3. **Quarterly**
   - Conduct security review
   - Update documentation
   - Review and update security policies
