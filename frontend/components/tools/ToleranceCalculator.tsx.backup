```tsx
// Deprecated shim removed: the component has been renamed to `BloodLevelCalculator`.
// Keep a sentinel export that throws if accidentally imported so remaining
// references fail loudly during development and can be migrated.
export default function ToleranceCalculatorDeprecated() {
	throw new Error('ToleranceCalculator has been removed. Import BloodLevelCalculator from "./BloodLevelCalculator" instead.');
}

```
