1. Small tools (Prozentual kcal defizit calc and others)
  * 1kg of fat has 7000kcal
  * 1kg of muscles have about 1200kcal 
    * [note: this was done a while ago, and is in children who were recovering from significant illness](http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/30/9/1514)

  * based on the formula:
      muscles = m, fat = f, mcal defizit = b, weight loss = w:
      (b - 1.2*w) / 5.8 = f
      w - f = m
